Course Description

Natural language processing is ubiquitous in modern intelligent technologies, serving as a foundation for language translators,
virtual assistants, search engines, and many more. In this course, we cover the foundations of modern methods for natural language processing,
such as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, transformers, and pretraining, and how they can be applied to important tasks in the field, 
such as machine translation and text classification. We also cover issues with these state-of-the-art approaches (such as robustness,
interpretability, sensitivity), identify their failure modes in different NLP applications, and discuss analysis and mitigation techniques for 
these issues.
